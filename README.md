# Abel GÃ³mez's (kind of) Orbit Repository

This repository provides bundles containing 3rd party libraries not available in the official Eclipse Orbit repository (http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/) and used in some of my Eclipse-based projects.

Just include the following update site:

## :warning: Warning! Warning! Warning! :warning:

For convenience purposes, some of the bundles contained in this repository contain all their transitive dependencies all together (e.g., HBase).
While this is normally fine when using the bundles in Eclipse/OSGi-based environments, this may be a source of problems (a.k.a. [JAR Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Classloader#JAR_hell)) when the bundles are used in unplanned ways (e.g., extracting the bundle contents and blindly adding the packaged JARs to the classpath of a regular Java application).
Such problems may happen unnoticeably, and in case they arise, they may be hard to chase and fix.

**You've been warned :grin:**
