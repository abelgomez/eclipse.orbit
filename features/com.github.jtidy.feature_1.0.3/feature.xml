      JTidy is a Java port of HTML Tidy, a HTML syntax checker and
pretty printer. Like its non-Java cousin, JTidy can be used as
a tool for cleaning up malformed and faulty HTML. In addition,
JTidy provides a DOM interface to the document that is being
processed, which effectively makes you able to use JTidy as a
DOM parser for real-world HTML.
